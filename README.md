===================

Templates to carry out Local Authority asset valuations for the year end accounts in accordance with the IFRS* based Code of Practice on Local Authority Accounting in the UK. Can you make use of them or improve them?

We use these documents as a template to carry out Local Authority asset valuations for the year end accounts in accordance with the IFRS* based Code of Practice on Local Authority Accounting in the UK.  I am sharing them because other government authorities must be creating something similar, so would love to share resources and ideas on how to improve the templates.  What we’d really like is for someone to add a componentisation template at the bottom of each spread sheet.  Also, on the Fair Value template, the end of the spread sheet with the various valuation options is a bit clunky and could do with improvement – usually the valuers leave in the whole template which looks messy.  Sometimes the rounding creates a nil value for land value – can anyone improve to include “IF” in the formula?   I’m no technical excel wizard, so all improvement contributions gratefully received.

If anyone has the expertise to convert these (Microsoft format) spreadsheets into an open standard format while preserving functionality, that would be cool too!
